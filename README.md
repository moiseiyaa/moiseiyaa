Hi there! 👋

I'm MOISE IYAA, a full-stack developer. I thrive on creating innovative solutions that make a difference.

🔭 I’m currently working on a platform that connects local farmers to urban consumers, ensuring fresh produce delivery within Kigali.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that aim to empower communities through technology.
🤝 I’m looking for help with implementing scalable microservices architecture.
🌱 I’m currently learning GraphQL and its integration with React.
💬 Ask me about developing responsive web applications or the tech scene in Rwanda.
⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring Kigali's vibrant art scene or hiking the beautiful hills of Rwanda.
